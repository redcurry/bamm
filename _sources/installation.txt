Installation
============

1. Download the latest version of BAMM.

2. This file is compressed. To uncompress it, run the following command
   from the directory in which BAMM was downloaded::

       tar -xzf bamm-1.0.tar.gz

3. This will create the directory bamm-1.0.
   Go into this directory and compile the programs as follows::

       cd bamm-1.0
       . makebamm.sh
       . makebammtrait.sh

4. This will create two executable files: ``bamm`` and ``bammtrait``.
